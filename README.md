# JWB.OS

This is my own OS for ComputerCraft.
It has a file manager, console, and a menu for common program shortcuts.

Download it by running

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JWBstuhr/JWB.OS/main/JWB.OS-WGet-Installer.lua jwbos-installer.lua`

in the Computer shell.

# JWBUtility

I also have a side utility for downloading all my other programs.
Download it by running

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JWBstuhr/JWB.OS/main/jwbutility.lua jwbutility`

in the Computer Shell.
